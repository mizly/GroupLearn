# GroupLearn

A website for linking people together in the pursuit of knowledge

# Inspiration

We are students taking the IB program, which is known for being notoriously heavy on studying. This project aims to solve that problem by making studying more fun while making new friends!

# What it does

GroupLearn is a website that allows for students to search for possible study partners.
By setting up an account and visiting the listings, users can look for and put up study requests.

Some of the possible search filters are:
- Grade
- Subject
- Days available
    - Times available

# How we built it

We built the website using a combination of Flask/Python for the backend and HTML for the frontend. 

# Challenges we ran into

This was the first time that we used Flask, so we had to learn many things along the way (shoutout to StackOverflow). OAuth integration was a huge pain, and we only managed to add in Discord integration after countless hours of failure. Working with Firebase proved to be a challenge as well, and when we had problems with that we couldn't work on the rest of the project. We also tried to add in a native messaging feature, but that was scrapped because we couldn't make one

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

We learned how to use Flask and Firebase, so that's cool! Integrating OAuth is pretty nice as well, as it allows users to link their Discord to the account, providing a platform for users to match. We also tried to make the website look somewhat pretty, and we're pretty proud of the CSS animations.

# What's next?

We hope to add in native messaging as well as more integration options. Maybe add in more functionality, like search sort by interests/grade/time available.

# How to access it

We actually have yet to host the website somehwere, but we'll get around to it soon!

# The people who built it
